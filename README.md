# image-txt
Encoder and Decoder to convert an image into text.

## Working

### Encoder

Name the image that you want to encode as sample_encoded.jpg (or alternatively, rename the original file in encoder.py). Run the program, and wait for it to produce the encoded.txt file.

### Decoder

Make sure you have the encoded.txt file in same directory as decoder.py. Run the program, and wait for the sample_decoded.jpg to be produced.


## Motivation

Imagine finding yourself in a flight where you can send unlimited text messages through social media apps, but you aren't allowed to send images. This image encoder can help you break your image into a series of text messages (which you could send through the app) which can finally be decoded to convert the text messages back into the original image.
